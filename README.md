- Cross platform: pdf files can be created on all platforms. Use anything as an IDE: Word, Latex, ... The possibilities are truly endless.

## Language specification

xfuck source files are PDF files. The first eight characters of the pdf should have eight different fonts, each corresponding to [one letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck#Commands) of brainfuck.

The only allowed text characters in the PDF are the character `'X'` or whitespace. Other characters are a syntax error. An exception is the string `X Ã† A-12`, which is the same as  a single `X`. Other content, such as images or embedded SWF files are ignored.

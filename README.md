# xfuck

`xfuck` (pronounced 'crossfuck') is an esoteric programming language based on fonts. It is revolutionary, portable and minimal - an interpreter can be written in less than 300 lines of Python.
The source code of an xfuck program is the fonts embedded in a PDF, interpreted as brainfuck commands. This provides incredible flexibility, and a rich ecosystem of literally billions of already existing valid programs.

xfuck was inspired by [this xkcd](https://xkcd.com/2309/):

## Random ideas / features

- Cross platform: pdf files can be created on all platforms. Use anything as an IDE: Word, Latex, ... The possibilities are truly endless.

## TODO:

- example fies in latex, word, libreoffice, html (export to pdf using e.g. browser)

## Language specification

xfuck source files are PDF files. The first eight characters of the pdf should have eight different fonts, each corresponding to [one letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck#Commands) of brainfuck.

The only allowed text characters in the PDF are the character `'X'` or whitespace. Other characters are a syntax error. An exception is the string `X Ã† A-12`, which is the same as  a single `X`. Other content, such as images or embedded SWF files are ignored.

## Usage instructions

Install dependencies (python 3):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Compile (in the repository root folder):
```
./xfk inputfile.pdf [--compile]
```
By default, this command executes the code in `inputfile.pdf`. If the `--compile` flag is given, it instead outputs the contents of the input file as brainfuck source code to stdout.

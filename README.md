# xfuck

`xfuck` (pronounced 'crossfuck') is an esoteric programming language based on fonts. It is revolutionary, portable and minimal - an interpreter can be written in less than 300 lines of Python.
The source code of an xfuck program is the fonts embedded in a PDF, interpreted as brainfuck commands. This provides incredible flexibility, and a rich ecosystem of literally billions of already existing valid programs.
In addition, PDF output is so ubiquitous that xfuck enables the user to write their program in a wide range of development environments, which were previously unsuitable for coding. These include (but are no limited to) Microsof Word, Excel, LaTeX, HTML files (via printing to PDF), or even by hand on a plain piece of paper and the help of an OCR program. The possibilities are truly endless.

For example, a program that prints 'hello world' looks like this:

![hello-x](doc/screenshot-hello-x.png)

You can see the full source code for this example in [`examples/hello-x.pdf`](examples/hello-x.pdf).

xfuck was inspired by [this xkcd](https://xkcd.com/2309/):

xfuck was created as part of [stupid hack 2020](https://app.hackjunction.com/events/stupidhack2020).

## Usage

Install dependencies (python 3):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run an xfuck program with the following command:
```
./xfk inputfile.pdf
```
To output the brainfuck source generated by xfuck instead of executing it, give a `.bf` file as an extra parameter:
```
./xfk inputfile.pdf outputfile.bf
```

To convert a brainfuck source file to an xfuck-compatible pdf, run the command
```
./xfk source.bf
```
By default, this command executes the code in `inputfile.pdf`. If the `--compile` flag is given, it instead outputs the contents of the input file as brainfuck source code to stdout.
